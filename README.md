# sid-player

SID Player aims to be a SID-file music audio visualizer for the browser. It is already fully functional, but it's on its VERY early development stages. It aims to offer audio synthesis capabilities as close as possible to MOS Technology's `SID 6581` and/or `SID 8580`.

## Future set of features:

In a few days a dropdown list with all server-served sid files will be available, as much as functions like `next`, `previous`, `random`, `play`, `pause` (and other basic player functionalities like volume control), `file-info` and `file-upload` (so you can listen to your local sid files on your browser).

New audio-reactive background shaders and waveform visualizer's styles will be also available and seamlessly browsable ( like the background shaders you can see at my personal website [https://mgz.me](https://mgz.me) ).

**THIS PROJECT IS A WIP. Please expect it to have a lot of room for improvements for now.**

You can view the final result / production build at [https://sid.mgz.me](https://sid.mgz.me)

*If you are a composer, and you're interested on having your songs exposed on this project, please get in touch through my email `me@mgz.me` and send me your .sid files.*

## Development

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode, making it available with real-time preview at [http://localhost:3000] with lint errors in the browser's console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, correctly bundling React in production mode by optimizing the build for the best file compression, minification and viewing performance.
